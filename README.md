> As I've explored the world of data analytics and data science, one thing was clear, and that is that a lot of the work shared was not clear. Coming from the marketing and communications world where the care and attention-to-detail is imperative and understanding your audience is vital, I hope to implement these best practices into my work.

"As I've delved into the realm of data analytics and data science, a recurring observation became evident: many shared works lacked clarity. Coming from a background in marketing and communications, where precision and audience understanding are paramount, my goal is to infuse these best practices into my own work."
